                Action sports, adventure sports or extreme sports are activities perceived as involving a high degree of risk.[1][2][3] These activities often involve speed, height, a high level of physical exertion and highly specialized gear.[1] Extreme tourism overlaps with extreme sport. The two share the same main attraction, "adrenaline rush" caused by an element of risk, and differ mostly in the degree of engagement and professionalism.

        <h2 class="description">BIKING</h2> 
        </div>
        <p>Cycle sport is competitive physical activity using bicycles. There are several categories of bicycle racing including road bicycle racing, cyclo-cross, mountain bike racing, track cycling, BMX, and cycle speedway. Non-racing cycling sports include artistic cycling, cycle polo, freestyle BMX and mountain bike trials. The Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) is the world governing body for cycling and international competitive cycling events. The International Human Powered Vehicle Association is the governing body for human-powered vehicles that imposes far fewer restrictions on their design than does the UCI. The UltraMarathon Cycling Association is the governing body for many ultra-distance cycling races
            <br> <br>
            Mountain bike races are held off-road and involve moderate to high degree of technical riding. There are several varieties; the main categories are cross-country, enduro and downhill but also 4X or four-cross racing.

            <h2 class="description">PARAGLIDING</h2> 
            </div>
            <p>Paragliding is the recreational and competitive adventure sport of flying paragliders: lightweight, free-flying, foot-launched glider aircraft with no rigid primary structure.[1] The pilot sits in a harness or in a cocoon-like 'pod' suspended below a fabric wing. Wing shape is maintained by the suspension lines, the pressure of air entering vents in the front of the wing, and the aerodynamic forces of the air flowing over the outside.
                <br> <br>
                Despite not using an engine, paraglider flights can last many hours and cover many hundreds of kilometres, though flights of one to five hours and covering some tens of kilometres are more the norm. By skillful exploitation of sources of lift, the pilot may gain height, often climbing to altitudes of a few thousand metres

                <h2 class="description">SURFING</h2> 
                </div>
                <p>Surfing involves standing on a specially designed surf board and riding a breaking wave.

                    There is nothing quite like the experience of catching one of nature forces, the breaking wave. You are able to harness that power to speed you along the wave and perform a variety of manoeuvres. ASI provides the skills, knowledge and framework to help you develop your surfing skills, pursue a career as an outdoor recreation instructor or sports coach, or become a professional competition surfer.

                    Shortboard Surfing 
                Uses a small board usually under 7ft.  It is very unstable but is very manouverable allowing the surfer to perform manoeuvres more easily. 


                Longboarding /  (Malibu Surfing)
                Use long wide board usually 9ft over in length.  They are a stable board, making it easier to ride, but less manoeuvreable.  Surfers use special longboarding manoeuvres such as “hanging ten”.
                Traditional Surfing
                Defined as pre 1969 surfing style criteria and includes all board styles and types, including"

                Early 70 twin fins. 
                The surfer is focussed more on continual motion, style and grace.
